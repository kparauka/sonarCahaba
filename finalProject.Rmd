Load required packages.

Read data in from GitHub.
```{r}
lCahabaSubs <- rast(file.choose()) # read in the substrate raster from GitHub
values(lCahabaSubs) = as.character(values(lCahabaSubs))
# you may need to redefine the values as characters here (e.g. values(nlcd) = as.character(values(nlcd)))

plot(lCahabaSubs) # test plot
```
Give the numbers category names and plot the new raster
```{r}
# give the numbers category names
categories <- data.frame('ID' = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7),
                         'category' = c('finesRipple', 'finesFlat', 'cobbleBoulder', 'hardBottom', 'wood', 'other', 'shadow'))
lCahabaSubs <- categories(lCahabaSubs, value = categories)

# plot the new raster
ggplot(lCahabaSubs, aes(x=x, y=y, fill=category)) +

                 'category' = c('finesRipple', 'finesFlat', 'cobbleBoulder', 'hardBottom', 'wood', 'other', 'shadow'))

# Total area of each habitat type
lsm_c_ca(lCahabaSubs, directions=8) %>%
  left_join(classCats, by = 'class')

# Mean of patch area
lsm_c_area_mn(lCahabaSubs, directions=8) %>%
  left_join(classCats, by = 'class')

# Standard deviation of patch area
lsm_c_area_sd(lCahabaSubs, directions=8) %>%
  left_join(classCats, by = 'class')

# The metrics above should give you a good idea of patch structure (e.g. many small patches vs. few large patches)
```
*Landscape metrics*
```{r}
# Contagion (aggregation metric)
lsm_l_contag(lCahabaSubs) # probability of two random cells belonging to the same class; based on cell adjacencies; approaches CONTAG = 0 if all cells are unevenly distributed and 100 indicates that all cells are equally adjacent to all other classes.

# Interspersion and juxtaposition (may be redundant)
lsm_l_iji(lCahabaSubs) # IJI is an ’Aggregation metric’; it is a so called "salt and pepper" metric and describes the intermixing of classes (i.e. without considering like adjacencies - the diagonal of the adjacency table); approaches 0 if a class is only adjacent to a single other class and equals 100 when a class is equally adjacent to all other classes

# Large patch dominance
lsm_l_lpi(lCahabaSubs) # The largest patch index is an ’Area and edge metric’; it is the percentage of the landscape covered by the largest patch in the landscape. It is a simple measure of dominance.

# Proximity

# Euclidean nearest neighbor metrics do not make sense in a riverscape. The Euclidean distance would operate outside the confines of the water. 

lsm_l_shdi(lCahabaSubs) # Shannon's diversity index

lsm_l_shei(lCahabaSubs) # Shannon's evenness index
